## Hi there, my name is Laci Krétai 👋
`Pronounciation: Lawt-si cree-tay`
`Preferred name: Leslie`

I'm a Primary Care Paramedic from Canada.
I like to write open source code as a hobby and look at how healthcare systems can be built on open source.

## 📘 Currently Learning

- Rust
- C
- Tauri
- Tailwind CSS
- Vue
- React
- Elixir

## ⚖️ My Values
I strongly believe in information sovereignty and that everyone has a right to know exactly what the technology they use is doing with their information, I will refuse to help with anything that is counterproductive to this.

As a mutualist, I believe in the principles of mutual aid and cooperation. That's why I use the [Peer Production License](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License) for most of my work. This license is designed to promote collaboration and prevent the commons dilemma of private interests adopting open source work to develop upon it and close off their developments to try and kill off support for the very communities they benefit from.

If I made something you like and you want me to work on it more; feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lacikretai).

Thanks for stopping by!
